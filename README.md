## Overview

This repository contains the scripts and supplemental data from my master thesis entitled:

**“Transcriptomic and genomic signatures of insecticide response in *Anopheles coluzzii* from Burkina Faso exposed to chlorfenapyr-treated bed nets.”**

Both Bash and R scripts (mostly used for plotting and downstream data manipulation) can be found in their corresponding directories.

Enjoy 🙂
